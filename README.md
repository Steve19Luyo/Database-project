Project Definition: School Feeding Program Database

Our team has been tasked with developing a robust database system to manage and monitor school feeding programs, specifically focusing on tracking food distribution, student attendance, and the nutritional impact of meals provided to students. This project seeks to address the challenge of ensuring that students receive proper nutrition as part of their educational experience, contributing to better health and learning outcomes.

This initiative aligns with *Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2: Zero Hunger*, which aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. In the Kenyan context, there is a significant gap in the implementation of structured and efficient catering systems within schools. While a few institutions, such as Merishaw School, have demonstrated some success in feedback and monitoring systems, the majority of Kenyan schools still lack an effective mechanism to ensure the quality and impact of the meals provided. Our database will aim to address this gap by providing a centralized, transparent, and scalable solution.

Scope and Objectives

The scope of this project involves the *design, development, and implementation* of a comprehensive and centralized database system that will manage key aspects of school feeding programs across Kenyan schools. The primary focus areas include:
- Food Distribution Logistics: Tracking food deliveries and distribution to ensure timely and accurate supply to schools.
- Student Attendance Records: Monitoring attendance trends, particularly in relation to the availability of meals, to measure the program’s effect on school participation.
- Nutritional Impact Monitoring: Collecting and analyzing health data to evaluate how the feeding program influences student nutrition and overall well-being.
- 
      Objectives.
- Objective 1: Create a system that efficiently tracks food distribution from suppliers to schools, ensuring accountability and transparency in the supply chain.
- Objective 2: Implement an attendance management module that correlates with meal availability, providing insights into how feeding programs affect school attendance.
- Objective 3: Develop a nutritional tracking feature that allows the input of key health indicators such as weight, height, and BMI, enabling schools to assess the impact of meals on student health over time.
- Objective 4: Generate detailed reports that can be used by various stakeholders to assess program effectiveness and make data-driven decisions for improvement.

Stakeholders

The success of this project hinges on the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders, each of whom plays a critical role in the management and evaluation of school feeding programs.

- Government Agencies: The *Ministry of Education* and the *Ministry of Health* are primary stakeholders. They will use the data generated by the database to evaluate the effectiveness of feeding programs, develop policies, and plan future initiatives for scaling and improvement.
  
- School Administrators: These individuals are responsible for the day-to-day management of the feeding program at the school level. They will be inputting attendance, nutritional, and logistical data into the system and ensuring that records are kept up to date.
  
- Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): Many NGOs are involved in funding or supporting feeding programs, especially in low-income or rural areas. Access to accurate data will allow them to optimize their efforts, secure additional funding, and report on the success of their initiatives.
  
- Parents and Students: Students are the primary beneficiaries of the program, as they receive the nutritional support needed for better academic and physical performance. Parents also indirectly benefit from the program as it ensures their children’s well-being and reduces their financial burden.
  
- Program Coordinators: Individuals or teams responsible for managing food distribution and logistics at a regional or national level. They will use the database to track deliveries, identify potential supply issues, and ensure that resources are used efficiently.
