- Food Distribution Logistics: Tracking food deliveries and distribution to ensure timely and accurate supply to schools.
- Student Attendance Records: Monitoring attendance trends, particularly in relation to the availability of meals, to measure the programâ€™s effect on school participation.
- Nutritional Impact Monitoring: Collecting and analyzing health data to evaluate how the feeding program influences student nutrition and overall well-being.
- 
      Objectives.
- Objective 1: Create a system that efficiently tracks food distribution from suppliers to schools, ensuring accountability and transparency in the supply chain.
- Objective 2: Implement an attendance management module that correlates with meal availability, providing insights into how feeding programs affect school attendance.
- Objective 3: Develop a nutritional tracking feature that allows the input of key health indicators such as weight, height, and BMI, enabling schools to assess the impact of meals on student health over time.
- Objective 4: Generate detailed reports that can be used by various stakeholders to assess program effectiveness and make data-driven decisions for improvement.
